**ENUNCIADO**

Build a UML class diagram that represents different types of vehicles. An abstract class Vehicle contains the characteristics of all of possible vehicles, although each type of vehicle implements them in a different way.  All vehicles have a position, they can move at a certain speed, and in a certain Environment (which can be "land", "water" or "air"). A move() operation moves the vehicle for the number of seconds indicated by its argument. 

The model allows defining instances of Land, Marine and Amphibious vehicles. The former move only in "land" environments, and can move at a maximum speed of 30 m/s. Marine vehicles can only move in "water" environments, and their maximum speed is 10 m/s. Finally, amphibious vehicles can move in "land" or "water" environments, and their maximum speed coincides with that of land or marine vehicles depending on the environment they are in.

**ENUNCIADO**

Build a UML class diagram that represents a football league where teams play against each other in matches. Each team has a home stadium, and in each match one team plays as either the local or visiting team. The information collected from a match includes the number of goals scored by the local and visiting teams, and whether or not the match has been played.

In addition, once played, the match collects information about the team that won the match, in case there is no goal draw. During the league, each team plays one local and one visiting match against all other teams. Of course, a team cannot play against itself. Two operations, localGoal() and visitorGoal(), take care of updating the result of the match while it is being played.  Once the match is finished, these two operations have no effect.

@enduml

TRADUCIDO DE USE A PLANTUML:

Here's the PlantUML code that represents the FootballLeague model:

kotlin

Copy code

@startuml

class League

class Team

class Stadium

Teams "0..*" -- "*" Team

League "1" -- "*" Match

Team "*" -- "*" Match : plays

Team "*" --> "1" Stadium : home stadium

class Match {

  finished : Boolean = false

  localGoals : Integer = 0

  visitorGoals : Integer = 0

  +localGoal() : void

  +visitorGoal() : void

}

Match "*" -- "*" Winner

Winner --> "0..1" Team : winner

@enduml

In this PlantUML code, we define the classes League, Team, Stadium, and Match. We then define the associations and aggregation relationships between these classes using the appropriate PlantUML keywords (-->, --, and *--*). Finally, we define the Winner association class and its relationship with Match and Team.

Note that the PlantUML code does not include the constraints from the original USE model, as PlantUML is a visualization tool and not a modeling language with formal semantics. However, you can still use PlantUML to create diagrams that help you understand and communicate your model.

```


**ENUNCIADO**

Build a UML class diagram that represents possible loans from a bank to its customers. Each customer may have **_at most one loan_** with each bank.

Information associated with each loan should include the total amount of the loan, the starting year, the number of installments in which the loan is to be repaid and the amount currently outstanding. The amount to be paid in each of the installments corresponds to the total amount of the loan divided by the number of installments. The customer pays each of these installments using the operation "payInstallment()"  which reduces the outstanding amount by the amount of one installment, until the full amount of the loan is paid. In addition, the following requirements must be met: 

(1) A customer cannot have more than one loan with a number of installments greater than 12, although it can have many others of a shorter duration.

(2) A bank may not have more than 30 % of its loans with a number of installments greater than 12.

(3) The starting years of the loans of the same customer cannot coincide, as it is assumed that a person cannot sign two loans in the same year.

The company generates an order if there are enough units of that product in stock. Once an i included in an order, it is no longer in the stock of the company. The order includes the total amount to be paid by the customer, which corresponds to the sum of the prices of the units included in the order. All units must have a serial number.
