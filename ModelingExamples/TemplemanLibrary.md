# The Templeman Library at the University of Kent

## Context

The University of Kent Library has the following rules to regulate the processes of borrowing items from the library to dispose of them for a few days.

(1) Only faculty members and undergraduate and graduate students may borrow items.
(2) Items that can be borrowed are books and journals.
(3) The Chief Librarian may temporarily suspend the loan of any item, or cancel them when they are no longer in loanable condition.
(4) Loans must be requested from one of the librarians. 
(5) There are limits on the number of items each type of user may have on loan at any given time, and on the duration each item may be borrowed. The Chief Librarian is responsible for setting these limits. By default, these are as follows:
    * Undergraduate students may have up to 3 books on loan at any one time. They may not borrow journals. Books may be borrowed for up to 7 days.
    * Graduate students may borrow up to 8 items (books or journals) simultaneously. They may have the journals for 3 days and the books for two weeks. 
    * Professors may borrow up to 16 items (books or journals) simultaneously. They may have the journals for 2 weeks and the books for 8 weeks. 
(6) Borrowed items must be returned before their deadlines. Users who fail to return an item on time will be charged a daily fine according to the established rates. 
(7) Borrowers must return items to librarians, along with the corresponding fine in case of late return of the loan.
(8) A librarian can withdraw borrowing rights from any user if the user does not pay the fine in full at the time of returning the loan.
