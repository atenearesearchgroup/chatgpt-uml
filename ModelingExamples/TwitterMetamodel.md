# Twitter Metamodel

## Context

We want to develop a metamodel for a basic subset of Twitter.

## Questions

1. Develop a metamodel (i.e., a UML model with its abstract syntax) for Twitter, with its main concepts. It should include at least the  concepts of Tweet, User, DirectMessage, List, and Hashtag, as well as the relationships between them, e.g., Followers of a user, Mentions of a tweer, etc. Specify the appropriate integrity constraints (invariants) so that the models that can be built with that metamodel are correct.

2. Add methods to the Twitter metamodel developed above to perform the following operations: post a tweet; follow and unfollow a user; and retweet, like or reply to a tweet. Also include operations (queries) to be able to know the tweets of a user, their followers and the lists a user is in.  Specify their behavior using pre- and post-conditions in OCL.
