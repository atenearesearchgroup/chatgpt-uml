# A Metamodel for Java

## Context

We want to develop a metamodel for a basic subset of the Java programming language.

## Questions

Develop a UML class diagram with the abstract syntax of a subset of the Java programming language to allow the definition of classes, their attributes and methods. More specifically, it must be able to represent at least the following concepts: Basic Type (int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char), Class, Attribute, Method and Parameter (of a method). Attributes, methods and parameters must have a name and a type, which can be a basic type or a previously defined class. It must also be possible to describe the cardinality and visibility (public, protected, default or private) of the language elements. Finally, it must be possible to define inheritance relationships between classes. Include all required integrity constraints.
